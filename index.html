                    <h3>Web Hosting Operations Analyst<br>Since 2021</h3>
                    <p>Technical and humanized service to Shared Hosting, Cloud and VPS customers. In the handling of emails I support the configuration and handling of errors in client email software such as Outlook and Thunderbird as well as perform network tests to determine routes and possible jumps with failure and packet loss in the exchange of messages by SMTP, POP and IMAP protocols. In programming, I have daily contact with systems and pages developed in PHP or created with CMSs based on this language, which, mostly, need corrections in connection scripts with Database, forms, layouts, plugin installation, redirects and security certificates. I have less frequent contact with applications developed in Javascript and Java based Frameworks, C#, .</p>
